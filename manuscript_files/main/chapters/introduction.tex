Life is hard to imagine without elevators nowadays. According to ??, the number of tall buildings constructed keeps increasing every year. Elevators, which play a vital role as a means of transportation in multi-storied buildings, and their service quality are thus becoming increasingly important. Elevator controllers handle passenger calls while trying to optimize service quality, e.g. by minimizing passenger waiting time.

The core of classical and even state-of-the-art elevator control strategies are heuristics. Examples are [examples]. 

Heuristic control strategies are difficult and costly to design 
Not only are they suboptimal, heuristic control strategies are also inflexible, due to their inability to deal with 
% An increase in elevator efficiency can have several advantages: saving time, increasing productivity, and increasing passenger satisfaction.
