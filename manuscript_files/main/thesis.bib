  abstract =	"This paper describes the application of reinforcement
		 learning (RL) to the difficult real world problem of
		 elevator dispatching. The elevator domain poses a
		 combination of challenges not seen in most RL research
		 to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state
		 spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic
		 systems. Their states are not fully observable and they
		 are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival
		 rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of
		 which is responsible for controlling one elevator car.
		 The team receives a global reinforcement signal which
		 appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the
		 actions of the other agents, the random nature of the
		 arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state.
		 In spite of these complications, we show results that
		 in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic
		 elevator control algorithms of which we are aware.
		 These results demonstrate the power of RL on a very
		 large scale stochastic dynamic optimiz...",
